<p>
This chapter describes SWIG's support for translating Doxygen comments found in interface and header files into a target language's normal documentation language.
Currently only JavaDoc is supported.
</p>

<H2><a name="Doxygen_translation_overview"></a>35.1 Doxygen Translation Overview</H2>


<p>
The Doxygen Translation Module of SWIG is an ongoing effort from a <A HREF ="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">Google Summer of Code</A> proposal from Summer 2008.
It adds an extra layer of functionality to SWIG, allowing automated translation of <A HREF= "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen</A> formatted comments from input files into a documentation language more suited for the target language.
Currently this module only translates into JavaDoc for the SWIG Java Module, but other extensions are to be added in time.
</p>

<p>
Questions about running SWIG are best answered in the <a href="SWIG.html#SWIG">SWIG Basics</a> chapter as well as the target language modules. (For now, only <A href = "Java.html">Java</A>).
The behaviour of this functionality is wildly unpredictable if the interface file is not proper to begin with!
</p>

<H2><a name="Doxygen_file_preparation"></a>35.2 Preparations</H2>


<p>
To make use of the comment translation system, your documentation comments must be in properly formatted <A HREF= "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/">Doxygen.</A> They can be present in your main interface file or any header file that it imports.
It is advised that you are certain your comments compile properly with Doxygen before you try to translate them.
Doxygen itself is a deeper tool and can provide you better feedback for correct any syntax errors that may be present.
Please look at Doxygen's <A HREF = "http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/docblocks.html"> Documenting the code</A> for proper specificatons for comment format.
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
/*! This is describing class Shape
 \author Bob
 */

class Shape {
</pre></div>

<p>
Because this functionality is currently only extended to Java, you must be able to run SWIG's <A href = "Java.html">Java Module</A> in order to make use of this tool.
</p>
<H3><a name="Doxygen_running_swig"></a>35.2.1 Enabling Doxygen Translation</H3>


<p>
NOT YET ADDED (current development branch has this feature automatically enabled).
</p>

<H3><a name="Doxygen_additional_options"></a>35.2.2 Additional Commandline Options</H3>


<p>
ALSO TO BE ADDED (JavaDoc Autobrief?)
</p>

<H2><a name="Doxygen_to_javadoc"></a>35.3 Doxygen To JavaDoc</H2>


<p>
If translation is enabled, JavaDoc formatted comments should be automatically placed in the correct locations in the resulting module and proxy files.
</p>

<H3><a name="Doxygen_basic_example"></a>35.3.1 Basic Example</H3>


<p>
Here is an example segment from an included header file
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
/*! This is describing class Shape
 \author Bob
 */

class Shape {
public:
  Shape() {
    nshapes++;
  }
  virtual ~Shape() {
    nshapes--;
  };
  double  x, y; /*!&lt; Important Variables */
  void    move(double dx, double dy); /*!&lt; Moves the Shape */
  virtual double area(void) = 0; /*!&lt; \return the area */
  virtual double perimeter(void) = 0; /*!&lt; \return the perimeter */
  static  int nshapes;
};
</pre></div>

<p>
Simply running SWIG should result in the following code being present in Shapes.java
</p>

<div class="targetlang"><pre>

/**
 * This is describing class Shape  
 * 
 * @author	Bob  
 */

public class Shape {

...

/**
 * Important Variables  
 * 
 */
  public void setX(double value) {
    exampleJNI.Shape_x_set(swigCPtr, this, value);
  }

/**
 * Important variables  
 */
  public double getX() {
    return exampleJNI.Shape_x_get(swigCPtr, this);
  }

...

/**
 * @return	the area  
 */
  public double area() {
    return exampleJNI.Shape_area(swigCPtr, this);
  }

/**
 * @return	the perimeter  
 */
  public double perimeter() {
    return exampleJNI.Shape_perimeter(swigCPtr, this);
  }

</pre></div>



<p>
The code Java-wise should be identical to what would have been generated without this feature enabled.
When the Doxygen Translator Module encounters a comment it finds nothing useful in or cannot parse, it should not effect the functionality of the SWIG generated code.
</p>


<H3><a name="Doxygen_javadoc_tags"></a>35.3.2 JavaDoc Tags</H3>


<p>
Doxygen has a wealth of tags such as @latexonly that have no equivalent in JavaDoc.
As a result several tags that have no translation (or particular use, such as some linking and section tags) are supressed.
If you are interested in more of the specifics of JavaDoc, please visit <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/j2se/javadoc/writingdoccomments/">How to Write Doc Comments for the Javadoc Tool.</A>
</p>

<p>
<b>Doxygen and JavaDoc Equivalent Tags</b>
</p>
<div class="diagram"><pre>
* @param      
* @return      
* @exception   
* @author      
* @version     
* @see         
* @since       
* @serial      
* @deprecated  
</pre></div>

<H3><a name="Doxygen_other_tags"></a>35.3.3 Other Tags</H3>


<p>
Because there are no specific JavaDoc tags for some important information, some tags are given plain English descriptions of their presence, such as @bug.
This is a feature currently still being developed and it is likely that more information from the original Doxygen Comments will be reproduced as this module matures.
</p>
<H3><a name="Doxygen_bad_behaviour"></a>35.3.4 Bad Behaviour</H3>


<p>
There are some tags that the Doxygen Translator Module currently does not expect to encounter.
This includes the PHP-only Doxygen commands such as @publicsection:
</p>

<p>
<b> Completely Unsupported Tags</b>
</p>
<div class="diagram"><pre>
"annotatedclasslist", "classhierarchy", "define", "functionindex", 
"header", "headerfilelist", "inherit", "l", "postheader", "private",
 "privatesection", "protected", "protectedsection", "public", "publicsection"
</pre></div>

<p>
The parsing behaviour will be unpredictable if any of these are encountered for now.
This should eventually be changed so that they are simply ignored.
</p>
<p>
In general parsing errors should not interfere with the operation of SWIG itself.
Blank comments or lack of comments could be an indication of either a parsing error or a lack of meaningful tags in a specific blob of doxygen. 
</p>


<H3><a name="Doxygen_further_details"></a>35.3.5 Further Details</H3>


<p>
TO BE ADDED.
</p>


<H2><a name="Doxygen_developer_details"></a>35.4 Developer Information</H2>


<p>
Currently a good deal of this Module still needs some reworking, particularly on the side of the parser and JavaDoc producer.
</p>

<H3><a name="Doxygen_module_design"></a>35.4.1 Module Design</H3>


<p>
If this functionality is turned on, SWIG places all comments found into the SWIG parse tree.
Nodes contain an additional attribute called DoxygenComment when a comment is present.
Individual nodes containing Doxygen with Structural Indicators, such as @file, as their first command, are also present in the parse tree.
These individual "blobs" of Doxygen such as :
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
/*! This is describing function Foo
 \param x some random variable
 \author Bob
 \return Foo
 */
</pre></div>

<p>
are passed on individually to the DoxygenTranslator Module.
This module builds its own private parse tree and hands it to a separate class for translation into the target documentation language.
For example, <tt>JavaDocConverter</tt> is the JavaDoc module class.
</p>

<H2><a name="Doxygen_language_extension"></a>35.5 Extending to Other Languages</H2>


<p>
In general, an extension to another language requires a fairly deep understanding of the target language module, such as Modules/python.cxx for Python.
Searching for "doxygen" in the java.cxx module can give you a good idea of the process for placing documentation comments into the correct areas.
The basic gist is that anywhere a comment may reside on a node, there needs to be a catch for it in front of where that function, class, or other object is written out to a target language file.
The other half of extension is building a target documentation language comment generator that handles one blob at a time.
However, this is relatively simple and nowhere near as complex as the wrapper generating modules in SWIG.
See DoxygenTranslator/JavaDocConverter.cpp for a good example.
The target language module hands the DoxygenTranslator the blob to translate, and receives back a translated text.
</p>
<p>
<b> What is given to the Doxygen Translator</b>
</p>
<div class="code"><pre>
/*! This is describing function Foo
 \param x some random variable
 \author Bob
 \return Foo
 */
</pre></div>
<p>
<b> What is received back by java.cxx </b>
</p>
<div class="targetlang"><pre>
/** This is describing function Foo
 *
 * @param x some random variable
 * @author Bob
 * @return Foo
 */
</pre></div>
<p> Development of the comment translator itself is simplified by the fact that the DoxygenTranslator module can easily include a <tt>main</tt> function and thus be developed, compiled, and tested independently of SWIG.
