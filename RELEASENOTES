SWIG-1.3.28 summary:
- More powerful renaming (%rename) capability.
- More user friendly warning handling.
- Add finer control for default constructors and destructors. We discourage
  the use of the 'nodefault' option, which disables both constructors and
  destructors, leading to possible memory leaks. Use instead 'nodefaultctor'
  and/or 'nodefaultdtor'.
- Automatic copy constructor wrapper generation via the 'copyctor' option/feature.
- Better handling of Windows extensions and types.
- Better runtime error reporting.
- Add the %catches directive to catch and dispatch exceptions.
- Add the %naturalvar directive for more 'natural' variable wrapping.
- Better default handling of std::string variables using the %naturalvar directive.
- Add the %allowexcept and %exceptionvar directives to handle exceptions when
  accessing a variable.
- Add the %delobject directive to mark methods that act like destructors.
- Add the -fastdispatch option to enable smaller and faster overload dispatch
  mechanism.
- Template support for %rename, %feature and %typemap improved.
- Add/doc more debug options, such as -dump_module, -debug_typemaps, etc.
- Unified typemap library (UTL) potentially providing core typemaps for all
  scripting languages based on the recently evolving Python typemaps.
- New language module: Common Lisp with CFFI.
- Python, Ruby, Perl and Tcl use the new UTL, many old reported and hidden 
  errors with typemaps are now fixed.
- Initial Java support for languages using the UTL via GCJ, you can now use 
  Java libraries in your favorite script language using gcj + swig.
- Tcl support for std::wstring.
- PHP4 module update, many error fixes and actively maintained again.
- Allegrocl support for C++, also enhanced C support.
- Ruby support for bang methods.
- Ruby support for user classes as native exceptions.
- Perl improved dispatching in overloaded functions via the new cast and rank
  mechanism.
- Perl improved backward compatibility, 5.004 and later tested and working.
- Python improved backward compatibility, 1.5.2 and later tested and working.
- Python can use the same cast/rank mechanism via the -castmode option.
- Python implicit conversion mechanism similar to C++, via the %implicitconv
  directive (replaces and improves the implicit.i library). 
- Python threading support added.
- Python STL support improved, iterators are supported and STL containers can
  use now the native PyObject type.
- Python many performance options and improvements, try the -O option to test
  all of them. Python runtime benchmarks show up to 20 times better performance
  compared to 1.3.27 and older versions.
- Python support for 'multi-inheritance' on the python side.
- Python simplified proxy classes, now swig doesn't need to generate the
  additional 'ClassPtr' classes.
- Python extended support for smart pointers.

- Python backward compatibility improved, many projects that used to work
  only with  swig-1.3.21 to swig-1.3.24 are working again with swig-1.3.28
- Python test-suite is now 'valgrinded' before release, and swig also
  reports memory leaks due to missing destructors.

  Chicken, Tcl and Perl modules.

  XML, Lisp s-expressions, Tcl, Ruby and Python modules.
- Other minor improvements and bug fixes.

SWIG-1.3.25 summary:
- Improved runtime type system.  Speed of module loading improved in
  modules with lots of types.  SWIG_RUNTIME_VERSION has been increased

- Runtime library changes: Runtime code can now exist in more than one module
  and so need not be compiled into just one module
- Further improved support for templates and namespaces
- Overloaded templated function support added
- More powerful default typemaps (mixed default typemaps)
- Some important %extend and director code bug fixes

  MzScheme, Perl, Python and Ruby
