This directory contains the HTML for the SWIG users manual.

All of this HTML is hand-written.  However, section numbering, indices,
and the table of contents is generated automatically by the 'maketoc.py'
script. The Makefile has further information on how the various alternative
forms of the documentation is generated from the hand-written HTML.
