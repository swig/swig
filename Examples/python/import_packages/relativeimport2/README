This example tests the %import directive and -relativeimport option.

Use 'python runme.py' to run a test.

Overview:
---------

The example defines 2 different extension modules--each wrapping a separate C++
class.

     pyX/pkg2/pkg3/pkg4/foo.i  - Pkg4_Foo class
     pyX/pkg2/bar.i            - Pkg2_Bar class derived from Pkg4_Foo

The difference between this ('relativeimport2') case and the case
'relativeimport1' is the "distance" between importer and importee.

If everything works well, the package pyX.pkg2 shall load properly.

Unix:
-----
- Run make
- Run the test as described above
