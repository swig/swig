This example tests the %import directive and working with multiple modules.

There are two modules having same name but belonging to different packages.
This case is not correctly handled by swig 2.

The issue was reported as Source Forge bug #1297 and later as GitHub issue #7.

Use 'python runme.py' to run a test.

Overview:
---------

The example defines 2 different extension modules--each wrapping a separate C++
class.

  pkg1/foo.i - Pkg1_Foo class.
  pkg2/foo.i - Pkg2_Foo class (derived from Pkg1_Foo).

The pkg2/foo.i module uses %import to refer to pkg1/foo.i.

If everything works well, the module pkg2.foo shall load properly.

Unix:
-----
- Run make
- Run the test as described above.
