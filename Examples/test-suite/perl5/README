Test::More Support
==

Test::More is a standard perl test harness tool.
Support was added for for using Test::More in 1.3.28.
If adding a new test to this suite, please use Test::More.

There are a few legacy test cases which do not use Test::More and these ought to be converted:

disown
imports
overload_copy
profiletest
template_ref_type
