# Simple test of %newobject
#  * The purpose of this test is to confirm that a language module
#  * correctly handles the case when C++ class member functions (of both
#  * the static and non-static persuasion) have been tagged with the
#  * %newobject directive.
#
# Ruby's GC is somewhat broken in that it will mark some more stack space
# leading to the collection of local objects to be delayed.
# Thus, upon invocation, it sometimes you can wait up to several
# instructions to kick in.
