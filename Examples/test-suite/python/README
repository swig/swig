See ../README for common README file.

Any testcases which have _runme.py appended after the testcase name will be detected and run.

The _runme.py files needs to work for both Python 2.x and 3.x.

By default testcases are run with Python 3.  You can run make with PY2=1 to run test case with Python 2, eg.

  $ make voidtest.cpptest PY2=1
