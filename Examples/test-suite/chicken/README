Any testcases which have _runme.ss appended after the testcase name will be detected and run.
NOTE: I had to use _runme.ss because otherwise it would be hard to implement make clean
Since when SWIG runs it generates an example.scm file for every test, to clean those files
I needed to add a rm -f *.scm to make clean.  But we don't want the runme scripts to
disappear as well!

Any testcases which have _runme_proxy.ss appended after the testcase name will be detected
and run with the -proxy argument passed to SWIG.  SWIG will not be run with the -unhide-primitive
option, so the _runme_proxy.ss file must use only the tinyclos exported interface.
