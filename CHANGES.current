            SF Bug #1366 - Remove duplicate declarations of strtoimax and strtoumax in inttypes.i

2014-04-08: wsfulton
            [Java C#] Enums which have been ignored via %ignore and are subsequently
            used are handled slightly differently. Type wrapper classes are now generated
            which are effectively a wrapper of an empty enum. Previously in Java uncompilable
            code was generated and in C# an int was used.

2014-04-04: wsfulton
            Fix regression in 3.0.0 where legal code following an operator<< definition might
            give a syntax error. SF Bug #1365.

2014-04-03: olly
	    [PHP] Fix wrapping director constructors with default parameters
	    with a ZTS-enabled build of PHP.

2014-04-02: olly
	    [PHP] Pass the ZTS context we already have to avoid needing to
	    call TSRMLS_FETCH, which is relatively expensive.

2014-04-02: olly
	    [PHP] Pass ZTS context through to t_output_helper() so it works
	    with a ZTS-enabled build of PHP.  Reported by Pierre Labastie in
	    github PR#155.

2014-03-28: wsfulton
            [Java C# D Go] Fixes for C enums used in an API and the definition of the enum
            has not been parsed. For D, this fixes a segfault in SWIG. The other languages
            now produce code that compiles, although the definition of the enum is needed
            in order to use the enum properly from the target language.

2014-03-23: v-for-vandal
            [Lua] Fix for usage of snprintf in Lua runtime which Visual Studio does not have.
