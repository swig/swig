Version 3.0.3 (in progress)
===========================

2014-09-02: olly
	    [Python] Fix regression in indentation of python code produced with
	    -modern, introduced by changes in #188.  Reported by fabiencastan
	    in #218.

2014-09-01: olly
	    Issue an error for unknown SWIG preprocessor directives, rather
	    than quietly ignoring them.  Reported by jrhelsey in issue#217.

2014-08-15: talby
            [Perl] Include guard fix for nested modules from Anthony Heading (SF Patch #350).

2014-08-04: wsfulton
            [C#] Merge patch #200 from gpetrou - Changed CSharp license header to include auto-generated
            tag so that StyleCop ignores the files.

2014-08-04: wsfulton
            [Java] Merge patch #198 from Yuval Kashtan - Support for java.nio.ByteBuffer mapping to 
            unsigned char * in various.i in NIOBUFFER typemaps.

2014-07-14: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Change struct definition to use void *, not uint8, so
	    that the type is recorded as possibly containing
	    pointers.  This ensures that the 1.3 garbage collector
	    does not collect pointers passed to C++ code.

2014-07-01: wsfulton
            Fix SF Bug #1375 - Expansion of the $parentclassname special variable incorrectly contains 
            brackets in the expanded name.
