Version 3.0.0 (in progress)
============================

2013-12-23: vadz
            [Octave, Perl, Python, R, Ruby, Tcl] Change the length of strings created from fixed-size char
            buffers in C code.

            This is a potential backwards compatibility break: a "char buf[5]" containing "ho\0la" was
            returned as a string of length 5 before, but is returned as a string of length 2 now. Apply
            "char FIXSIZE[ANY]" typemaps to explicitly choose the old behaviour.

            C++11 support for new versions of erase and insert in the STL containers.

            The erase and insert methods in the containers use const_iterator instead
            of iterator in C++11.  There are times when the methods wrapped must match
            the parameters exactly. Specifically when full type information for
            template types is missing or SWIG fails to look up the type correctly,
            for example:

              %include <std_vector.i>
              typedef float Real;
              %template(RealVector) std::vector<Real>;

            SWIG does not find std::vector<Real>::iterator because %template using
            typedefs does not always work and so SWIG doesn't know if the type is
            copyable and so uses SwigValueWrapper<iterator> which does
            not support conversion to another type (const_iterator). This resulted
            in compilation errors when using the C++11 version of the containers.

            Closes #73

2013-12-18: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Don't require that Go environment variables be set
	    when running examples or testsuite when using Go 1 or
	    later.

2013-12-17: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Remove -longsize option (for backward compatibility,
	    ignore it if seen).

2013-12-17: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Add -go-pkgpath option.

2013-12-16: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Update for Go 1.2 release.  Add support for linking
	    SWIG code directly into executable, rather than using a
	    shared library.

2013-12-13: ianlancetaylor
	    [Go] Add SWIG source file name as comments in generated
	    files.  This can be used by Go documentation tools.

2013-12-12: jleveque
	    [Lua] Fix typo (wchar instead of wchar_t) which made wchar.i
	    for Lua useless.

2013-12-12: vmiklos
	    [PHP] PHP's peculiar call-time pass-by-reference feature was
	    deprecated in PHP 5.3 and removed in PHP 5.4, so update the REF
	    typemaps in phppointers.i to specify pass-by-reference in the
	    function definition.  Examples/php/pointer has been updated
	    accordingly.

2013-12-12: olly
	    [PHP] The usage of $input in PHP directorout typemaps has been
	    changed to be consistent with other languages.  The typemaps
	    provided by SWIG have been updated accordingly, but if you
	    have written your own directorout typemaps, you'll need to
	    update $input to &$input (or make equivalent changes).

            *** POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY  ***

2013-11-27: vadz
            [C#, Java, Python] Add std_auto_ptr.i defining typemaps for returning std::auto_ptr<>.

2013-11-09: wsfulton
            [C#] Apply patch #79 from Brant Kyser
              - Remove using directives from the generated C# code and fully qualify the use of all .NET
                framework types in order to minimize potential name collisions from input files defining
                types, namespace, etc with the same name as .NET framework members.
              - Globally qualify the use of .NET framework types in the System namespace
              - Remove .NET 1.1 support, .NET 2 is the minimum for the C# module

            This is a potential backwards compatibility break if code has been added relying on these using
            statements that used to be generated:

              using System;
              using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

            The quick fix to add these back in is to add the -DSWIG2_CSHARP command line option when
            executing SWIG. See CSharp.html documentation for more info.

2013-11-05: wsfulton
            [Java] Apply patch #91 from Marvin Greenberg - Add director:except feature for improved
            exception handling in director methods for Java.

2013-10-17: wsfulton
            [R] Fix SF #1340 - Visual Studio compile error in C++ wrappers due to #include <exception>
            within extern "C" block.

2013-10-17: wsfulton
            [Python] Fix SF #1345 - Missing #include <stddef.h> for offsetof when using -builtin.

2013-10-15: vadz
            Allow using \l, \L, \u, \U and \E in the substitution part of %(regex:/pattern/subst/)
            inside %rename to change the case of the text being replaced.

2013-10-12: wsfulton
            [Lua] Apply #92 - missing return statements for SWIG_Lua_add_namespace_details()
            and SWIG_Lua_namespace_register().

2013-10-12: wsfulton
            [CFFI] Apply #96 - superclass not lispify

2013-10-12: wsfulton
            Merge in C++11 support from the gsoc2009-matevz branch where Matevz Jekovec first
            started the C++0x additions. Documentation of the C++11 features supported is in a
            new Chapter of the documentation, "SWIG and C++11" in Doc/Manual/CPlusPlus11.html.

2013-10-04: wsfulton
            Fix %naturalvar not having any affect on templated classes instantiated with an
            enum as the template parameter type. Problem reported by Vadim Zeitlin.

2013-09-20: wsfulton
            [Java] Fix a memory leak for the java char **STRING_ARRAY typemaps.
