Version 3.0.0 (in progress)
============================

2013-11-27: vadz
            Add std_auto_ptr.i defining typemaps for returning std::auto_ptr<>.

2013-11-09: wsfulton
            [C#] Apply patch #79 from Brant Kyser
              - Remove using directives from the generated C# code and fully qualify the use of all .NET
                framework types in order to minimize potential name collisions from input files defining
                types, namespace, etc with the same name as .NET framework members.
              - Globally qualify the use of .NET framework types in the System namespace
              - Remove .NET 1.1 support, .NET 2 is the minimum for the C# module

            This is a potential backwards compatibility break if code has been added relying on these using
            statements that used to be generated:

              using System;
              using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

            The quick fix to add these back in is to add the -DSWIG2_CSHARP command line option when
            executing SWIG. See CSharp.html documentation for more info.
