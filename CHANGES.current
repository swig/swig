Version 1.3.32 (in progress)
============================
05/01/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Improved the documentation to document the new features
            added, add directorin/out/argout typemaps, etc.

05/01/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Added %initstack and %ignorestack directives for director
	    functions.  These allow you to control whether a director
	    function should re-init the ruby stack.  
	    This is sometimes needed for an embedded Ruby where the
	    director method is used as a C++ callback and not called
            by the user from ruby code.

04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Ruby will now report the parameter index properly on type
	    errors as well as the class and value of the incorrect
	    argument passed.
	    (feature request #1699670)

04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    STL files have been upgraded to follow the new swig/python 
	    Lib/std conventions.
	    std_vector.i now mimics the behavior of Ruby Arrays much more 
	    closely, supporting slicing, shifting, unshifting,
            multiple indexing and proper return values on assignment.
	    
	    COMPATABILITY NOTE: this changes the older api a little bit in 
	    that improper indexing would previously (incorrectly) raise
	    exceptions.  Now, nil is returned instead, following ruby's 
	    standard Array behavior.

04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Ruby no longer creates the free_Class function if the class
	    containes its own user defined free function (%freefunc).
	    (bug #1702882)
 
04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby]
	    Made directors raise a ruby expection for incorrect argout
	    returned values if RUBY_EMBEDDED is set, instead of throwing
	    an actual SwigDirector exception.
	    This will prevent crashes when ruby is embedded and unaware
	    of the SwigDirector exception.

04/30/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] 
	    Removed the need for -DSWIGEXTERN.
	    Changed swig_ruby_trackings to be a static variable, but also
	    be kept within a hidden instance variable in the SWIG module.
	    This allows properly dealing with trackings across multiple 
	    DSOs, which was previously broken.
	    (bug #1700535 and improvement to patch #1702907)

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] Fixed GC memory issues with trackings that could lead
	    to segfaults when dealing, mainly, with static variables.
	    (bug #1700535 and patch #1702907)

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] 
	    Fixed String conversion using old ruby1.6 macros.  Now
	    StringValuePtr() is used if available.  This removes warnings
	    when converting strings with \0 in them.
	    (bug #1700535 and patch #1702907)

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] 
	    Fixed the argout count in directors for Ruby.  Previously, 
	    ignored or "numinputs=0" typemaps would incorrectly not get 
	    counted towards the argout count.
	    (bug/patch #1545585)

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] 
	    Upgraded Ruby converter to recognize "numinputs=0".  Previously,
	    only the old "ignore" flag was checked (which would currently
	    still work properly, but is deprecated).

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby - but should be made generic] 

	    %feature("numoutputs","0") added.  

	    This feature allows you to ignore the output of a function so
	    that it is not added to a list of outpus values
	    ( ie. argouts ).  
	    This should also become a feature of %typemap(directorout)
	    as "numoutputs"=0, just like "numinputs"=0 exists.

	    %feature("directors"=1)

	    %include <typemaps.i>

	    %feature("numoutputs","0") { Class::member_function1 };
	    %typemap(out) MStatus { // some code, like ignore mstatus
	                            // and raise exception };

	    %inline %{
	      typedef int MStatus;
	      class Class {

	      // one argument returned, but director out code added
	      // MStatus is discarded.
	      virtual MStatus member_function1( int& OUTPUT );

	      // two arguments returned, director out code added
	      // MStatus is not discarded
	      virtual MStatus member_function2( int& OUTPUT );
	      };
            %}

04/29/2007: gga
	    [Ruby] 
	    Directors will now try to reset the ruby stack on the first call
	    to them if the developer sets the define RUBY_EMBEDDED.  
	    Explanation:
	    Ruby's GC needs to be aware of the running OS stack in order to
	    mark any VALUE (Ruby objects) it finds there to avoid collection
	    of them.  This allows the ruby API to be very simple and allows
	    you to write code like "VALUE a = sth" anywhere without needing 
	    to do things like refcounting like python.
	    By default, the start of the stack is set when ruby_init() is
	    called.   If ruby is inited within main(), as it usually is 
	    with the main ruby executable, ruby will be able to calculate
	    its stack properly.  However, when this is not possible, as when
	    ruby is embedded as a plugin to an application where main is not
	    available, ruby_init() will be called in the wrong place, and
	    ruby will be incorrectly tracking the stack from the function
	    that called ruby_init() only, which can lead to
	    all sorts of weird crashes or to ruby thinking it has run out of
	    stack space incorrectly.
	    To avoid this, director (callback) functions can now be tagged
	    to try to reset the ruby stack, which will solve the issues.
	    NOTE: ruby1.8.6 still contains a bug in it in that its function
	    to reset the stack will not always do so.  This bug is triggered
	    very rarely, when ruby is called from two very distinct places
	    in memory, like a branch of main() and another dso.  This bug
	    has now been reported to ruby-core and is pending further
	    investigation.
	    (bug #1700535 and patch #1702907)


04/21/2007: olly
	    Fix parsing of float constants with an exponent (e.g. 1e-02f)
	    (bug #1699646).

04/20/2007: olly
	    [Python] Fix lack of generation of docstrings when -O is used.
	    Also, fix generation of docstrings containing a double quote
	    character.  Patch from Richard Boulton in bug#1700146.

04/17/2007: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] Support for adding in Java/C# code before and after the intermediary call,
            specifically related to the marshalling of the proxy type to the intermediary type.
            The javain/csin typemap now supports the 'pre' and 'post' attributes to achieve this.
            The javain typemap also supports an optional 'pgcppname' attribute for premature garbage 
            collection prevention parameter naming and the csin typemap supports an optional 'cshin'
            attribute for the parameter type used in a constructor helper generated when the type is used
            in a constructor. Details in the Java.html and CSharp.html documentation.

04/16/2007: olly
	    Don't treat `restrict' as a reserved identifier in C++ mode
	    (bug#1685534).

04/16/2007: olly
	    [PHP5] Fix how zend_throw_exception() is called (bug #1700785).

04/10/2007: olly
	    Define SWIGTEMPLATEDISAMBIGUATOR to template for aCC (reported on
	    swig-user that this is needed).

04/04/2007: olly
	    [PHP5] If ZTS is enabled, release <module>_globals_id in MSHUTDOWN
	    to avoid PHP interpreter crash on shutdown.  This solution was
	    suggested here: http://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=40985

04/03/2007: olly
	    [PHP4] Add missing ZTS annotations to generated C++ wrapper code
	    to fix compilation failures when using ZTS enabled SWIG (Linux
	    distributions tend to disable ZTS, but notably the Windows build
	    uses it by default).

04/01/2007: efuzzyone
            [CFFI] Patch #1684261: fixes handling of unsigned int literals, thanks Leigh Smith.
            Also, improved documentation.
  
03/30/2007: olly
	    Avoid generating '<:' token when using SwigValueWrapper<> on a type
	    which starts with '::' (patch #1690948).

03/25/2007: wuzzeb (John Lenz)
	    [perl5] Add SWIG_fail to the SWIG_exception macro.  Fixes a few problems reported
	    on the mailing list.

03/23/2007: wsfulton
            String copying patch from Josh Cherry reducing memory consumption by about 25%.

03/21/2007: wsfulton
            [Java] Apply patch #1631987 from Ulrik Peterson - bool INOUT typemaps 
            fail on big endian machines.

03/16/2007: wsfulton
            Fix seg fault given dodgy C++ code: namespace abc::def { }

03/16/2007: wsfulton
            [Java] Fixes so that ARRAYSOFCLASSES and ARRAYSOFENUMS in arrays_java.i can be applied
            to pointer types.

03/03/2007: olly
	    [PHP5] When we know the literal numeric value for a constant, use
	    that to initialise the const member in the PHP wrapper class.

03/02/2007: olly
	    [PHP5] Fix PHP wrapper code generated for certain cases of
	    overloaded forms with default arguments.

02/26/2007: efuzzyone
            [CFFI] Patch #1656395: fixed hex and octal values bug, thanks to Arthur Smyles.

02/22/2007: mgossage
            [Lua] Fixed bug in typemaps which caused derived_byvalue and rname test cases to fail.
	    Updated derived_byvalue.i to explain how to find and fix the problem

01/25/2007: wsfulton
            Fix #1538522 and #1338527, forward templated class declarations without a
            name for the templated class parameters, such as:

              template <typename, class> class X;

01/23/2007: mgossage
            [Lua] Patch #1640862: <malloc.h> replaced by <stdlib.h>
	    Patch #1598063 Typo in typemaps.i

01/22/2007: mgossage
            [Lua] Added a lua specific carrays.i which adds the operator[] support.
	    modified the main code to make it not emit all the class member functions & accessors
	    Note: C structs are created using new_XXX() while C++ classes use XXX() (should be standardised)
	    Updated test case: li_carrays
	    Updated the documentation.

01/12/2007: wsfulton
            [Php] Add support for newfree typemaps (sometimes used by %newobject)

01/12/2007: beazley
            New command line option -macroerrors.   When supplied, this will force
            the C scanner/parser to report proper location information for code contained
            inside SWIG macros (defined with %define).  By default, SWIG merely reports
            errors on the line at which a macro is used.  With this option, you
            can expand the error back to its source---something which may simplify
            debugging.

01/12/2007: beazley
            [Internals] Major overhaul of C/C++ scanning implementation.  For quite
            some time, SWIG contained two completely independent C/C++ tokenizers--
            the legacy scanner in CParse/cscanner.c and a general purpose scanner
            in Swig/scanner.c. SWIG still has two scanning modules, but the C parser
            scanner (CParse/cscanner.c) now relies upon the general purpose
            scanner found in Swig/scanner.c.  As a result, it is much smaller and
            less complicated.  This change also makes it possible to maintain all
            of the low-level C tokenizing in one central location instead of two
            places as before. 

            ***POTENTIAL FLAKINESS***
            This change may cause problems with accurate line number reporting
            as well as error reporting more generally. I have tried to resolve this 
            as much as possible, but there might be some corner cases.  
            
01/12/2007: mgossage
            [Lua] Added typemap throws for std::string*, typemap for SWIGTYPE DYNAMIC, 
	    changed the existing throws typemap to throw a string instead of making a copy of
	    the object (updating a few test cases to deal with the change).
	    fixed test case: dynamic_casts, exception_partial_info, li_std_string, size_t

01/03/2007: beazley
            [Internals].  Use of swigkeys.c/.h variables is revoked.  Please use
            simple strings for attribute names.

12/30/2006: beazley
            Internal API functions HashGetAttr() and HashCheckAttr() have been revoked.
            Please use Getattr() to retrieve attributes.  The function Checkattr() can
            be used to check attributes.  Note:  These functions have been revoked 
            because they only added a marginal performance improvement at the expense
            code clarity. 

12/26/2006: mgossage
            [Lua] Added more STL (more exceptions, map, size_t), 
	    fixed test case: conversion_ns_template.

12/21/2006: mgossage
            [Lua] Update to throw errors when setting immutables, 
	    and allowing user addition of module variables.

12/20/2006: wsfulton
            Fix typedef'd variable wrappers that use %naturalvar, eg, std::string.

12/14/2006: wsfulton
            [C#] Add std::wstring and wchar_t typemaps

12/14/2006: olly
	    [php] Fix bug #1613673 (bad PHP5 code generated for getters and
	    setters).

12/02/2006: wsfulton, John Lenz, Dave Beazley
            Move from cvs to Subversion for source control

11/30/2006: beazley
            Cleaned up swigwarnings.swg file not to use nested macro
            definitions.

11/12/2006: wsfulton
            [Java, C#] Fix for %extend to work for static member variables.
