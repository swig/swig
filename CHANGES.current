Version 4.4.0 (in progress)
===========================

	    #2998 Drop support for specifying SWIG's internal type string
	    representation in interface files.  This "secret developer feature"
	    was only documented in developer documentation, and had no test
	    coverage.

	    It allowed specifying an SWIG internal syntax type string, e.g.:

	      `p.a(10).p.f(int, p.f(int).int)` foo(int, int (*x)(int));

	    In the unlikely event that anyone was using this, we recommend you
	    use the standard C/C++ type syntax instead, which will work with
	    previous SWIG releases too, e.g.:

	      (*(*foo(int, int (*)(int)))[10])(int, int (*)(int));

	    The C/C++ syntax has the major advantage of being the same syntax
	    that C/C++ compilers use.
