We're pleased to announce SWIG-2.0.4, the latest SWIG release.

What is SWIG?
=============

SWIG is a software development tool that reads C/C++ header files and
generates the wrapper code needed to make C and C++ code accessible
from other languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java,
Scheme (Guile, MzScheme, CHICKEN), D, Ocaml, Lua, Pike, C#, Modula-3,
Octave, R, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI). SWIG can also
export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions.  Major
applications of SWIG include generation of scripting language extension
modules, rapid prototyping, testing, and user interface development for
large C/C++ systems.
