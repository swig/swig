We're pleased to announce SWIG-3.0.4, the latest SWIG release.

What is SWIG?
=============

SWIG is a software development tool that reads C/C++ header files and
generates the wrapper code needed to make C and C++ code accessible
from other programming languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby,
PHP, C#, Go, Java, Javascript, Lua, Scheme (Guile, MzScheme, CHICKEN),
D, Ocaml, Pike, Modula-3, Octave, R, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL,
CFFI, UFFI).  SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML
and Lisp s-expressions.  Major applications of SWIG include generation
of scripting language extension modules, rapid prototyping, testing,
and user interface development for large C/C++ systems.
