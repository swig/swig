We're pleased to announce SWIG-2.0.10, the latest SWIG release.

What is SWIG?
=============

SWIG is a software development tool that reads C/C++ header files and
generates the wrapper code needed to make C and C++ code accessible
from other programming languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby,
PHP, C#, Go, Java, Lua, Scheme (Guile, MzScheme, CHICKEN), D, Ocaml,
Pike, Modula-3, Octave, R, Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI).
SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp
s-expressions.  Major applications of SWIG include generation of
scripting language extension modules, rapid prototyping, testing,
and user interface development for large C/C++ systems.
