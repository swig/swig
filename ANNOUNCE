*** ANNOUNCE: SWIG 1.3.37 (30 December 2008) ***

http://www.swig.org


We're pleased to announce SWIG-1.3.37, the latest installment in the
SWIG development effort.  SWIG-1.3.37 includes a number of bug fixes
and enhancements.

What is SWIG?
-------------

SWIG is a software development tool that reads C/C++ header files and
generates the wrapper code needed to make C and C++ code accessible
from other languages including Perl, Python, Tcl, Ruby, PHP, Java,
Scheme (Guile, MzScheme, CHICKEN), Ocaml, Lua, Pike, C#, Modula-3, Octave, R,
Common Lisp (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI). SWIG can also export its parse
tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions.  Major applications of
SWIG include generation of scripting language extension modules, rapid
prototyping, testing, and user interface development for large C/C++
systems.

Availability:
-------------
The release is available for download on Sourceforge at

     http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swig-1.3.37.tar.gz

A Windows version is also available at

     http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/swig/swigwin-1.3.37.zip

Release numbers
---------------
With SWIG-1.3, we are adopting an odd/even version numbering scheme for
SWIG.  Odd version numbers (1.3, 1.5, 1.7, etc...) are considered to
be development releases.  Even numbers (1.4,1.6,1.8) are stable
releases.  The current 1.3 effort is working to produce a stable 2.0
release.  A stable 2.0 release will not be made until it can
accompanied by fully updated documentation.  In the meantime, we will
continue to make periodic 1.3.x releases.

Please report problems with this release to the swig-dev mailing list,
